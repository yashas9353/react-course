# React Cource Learning from Hitesh youtube Channal

## Vite Commands

### To Create a new react project using Vite

**`npm create vite@latest`**

### Note : **Vite will only download necessary files but will not install dependencies which are there in package.json so once download is done, Get into the project directory then to install dependencies we use** **`npm install`**

### To Run react project, we can see in package.json scripts we have **dev** or any other script also we can start using `npm run dev`

### Note : package.json is the main file when you are dealing with node.js.
